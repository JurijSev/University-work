1. Count how many 0 are in the array
2. Checks how many values are in order
3. Use a placeholder for the i value as it gets overwritten
4. 

array = (27,14,77,85,34,16,58,34,29,39)
int x = input

for every index in the array{
	if x is equal to a value in the array{
		Return index of the value
	}
}

This algorithm is O(n)

5. 

array = ()
int largest = 0

for every index in array{
	if value at index > largest{
		replace largest with value at index
	}
}

return largest
